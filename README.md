# üìÇ **Loan Analytics**

## üìö *Introduction*
This project focuses on analyzing borrower risk and default behavior using key financial factors, including FICO credit scores, debt-to-income ratios (DTI), loan purposes, and geographical differences. The goal is to segment borrowers by risk levels, identify factors influencing default rates, and explore how these variables vary across different countries. By understanding these patterns, the project aims to optimize lending strategies, improve risk assessment processes, and identify opportunities for loan expansion in stable markets, ultimately driving lending business growth.

## üìù *Summary* 
In conclusion, our analysis reveals that the majority of borrowers have successfully repaid their loans, with only 17% defaulting. Firstly, the FICO score distribution is right-skewed, with most borrowers scoring between 675 and 725, and only a small proportion exceeding 775. Loans for debt consolidation have relatively low default rates, while loans for small business and education carry higher default risks. Additionally, there is an inverse relationship between FICO scores and default rates, and factors such as debt-to-income ratio (DTI), installment amounts, and revolving utilization are more strongly associated with default risk than income. Furthermore, defaults are dispersed across all income levels, with a higher concentration observed in the DTI range of 5-20. Geographically, China and France stand out with low default rates, while countries like Portugal, the U.S., and Indonesia exhibit higher default rates, indicating the need for more stringent approval processes in these regions.

## üí° *Suggestion*
* Targeted Risk Assessment for Loan Purposes: Given that loans for small businesses and educational purposes carry higher default risks, additional risk assessments could be implemented for borrowers applying for these types of loans.

* Monitor Installment Amounts and Revolving Utilization: Given the positive relationship between higher installment amounts, revolving utilization, and the risk of default, these factors should be included in predictive models to enhance accuracy.

* Given that China has high loan volumes and low default rates, it is an ideal market for lending expansion. Similarly, France, despite having smaller loan volumes, presents an attractive opportunity due to its low default rate.
